          At any time, but especially in this pandemic homeschooling era, we can
          default to grabbing whatever information and resources are
          easiest/quickest to access. However, easy and quick is not always
          synonymous with diverse, well-considered, and high-quality. These are
          free resources for educators and parents to use to engage and meet the
          needs of a broad spectrum of learners.
